# Z-aat

This repository contains a small prototype for a retro top-down RPG built with Pygame.
It demonstrates simple movement and displays a short Kabbalah lesson when run.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- `pygame`

Install dependencies:
```
pip install pygame
```

## Running
Execute the game with:
```
python game/main.py
```
A window will open allowing you to move a white square with the arrow keys.
A short lesson about the sefirot will print to the console at startup.
